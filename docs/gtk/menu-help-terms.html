The <a href="../ee-terms.pdf" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> document describes the end user license agreement under which the EE is provided free of charge to individual users, including students and teachers at educational institutions.  Please contact us at <a href="mailto:ee@equalizelearning.com">ee@equalizelearninglakepinesbraille.com</a> for information about other uses of the EE, which we would be happy to encourage!
