The <a href="../aee-privacy.pdf" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> document says that when we receive information about you, such as when you report issues, we do not share your personal information with anyone.  It just takes a few more words to say that in a way that ensures everyone remains safe when they use the web site!
